      mainAbout:'People expect web app pages to load fast. On the server, React lets you start streaming HTML while youâ€™re still fetching data, progressively filling in the remaining content before any JavaScript code loads. On the client, React can use standard web APIs to keep your UI responsive even in the middle of rendering. React approaches changes with care. Every React commit is tested on business-critical surfaces with over a billion users. Over 100,000 React components at Meta help validate every migration strategy.The React team is always researching how to improve React. Some research takes years to pay off. React has a high bar for taking a research idea into production. With React, you can be a web and a native developer. Your team can ship to many platforms without sacrificing the user experience. Your organization can bridge the platform silos, and form teams that own entire features end-to-end.',
